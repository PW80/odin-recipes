# Project: Recipes

A demonstration of basic `HTML` used to create a simple multi-page website that displays a few recipes.

- Built based on the assignment instructions from the **HTML Foundations** section of the **Foundation Course**
at [TheOdinProject](https://www.theodinproject.com).
- Does not include any styling - only `HTML` is on display.
